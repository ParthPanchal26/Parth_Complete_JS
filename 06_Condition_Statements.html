        The prompt Fucntion is not defined in node environment,<br>
        It is defined in client-side not in server side,<br>
        so whenever we use prompt in javascript file it will throw an error,<br>
        but when we use it inside "script" tag in HTML it will show it in browser that is client-side<br>
        so that it will execute perfectly without any errors.<br>

        => Value entered in "Prompt" will always considered as String
